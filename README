BUILD
  To build the library write

    make

  This will build both the staticaly and dynamicaly linked versions
  and also extract headers from source tree into include/.

DOCUMENTATION
  Documentation can be extracted from the source codes with doxygen.

    make doc

  Will create documentation into doc/ folder.

INSTALL
  In order to install this library to your Unix-like operating
  system you can use the generic Makefile.

  Write

    make

  to compile the code and

    sudo make install

  to install the binaries to /usr/local/bin and header files to
  /usr/local/include.

  You might have to hack the Makefile to make it work on some
  platforms (like Windows, Mac OS and others), but the code itself
  should be platform-independent.

TESTING
  Unit tests for the library are available in the test/ subdirectory. The
  UnitTest++ framework is required to run them. Specify path to frameworks
  library and headers in Makefile.

  In order to be able to build tests correctly, UnitTest++ framework
  must be installed or an include and link path must be set in the
  Makefile. See UNITTESTCPP_LIB and UNITTESTCPP_INCLUDE_DIR variables.
